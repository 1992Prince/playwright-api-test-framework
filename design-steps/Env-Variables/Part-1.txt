1) 		In PW u can set baseUrl in config file in use fun

	 use: {

		 baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
		}

	and then inside test you can use forward slash - page.goto('/')
	

2) Suppose you need to change baseUrl for diff envs like for staging env url will be diff, for prod env it will be diff

		This u can handle under projects section of config file.

		projects: [
			{
				name: 'dev',
				use: {
					baseURL: 'http://dev.google.com',
				}
			},
			{
				name: 'stg',
				use: {
					baseURL: 'http://stg.google.com',
				}
			}
		]

		And now you can run the command - npx playwright test --project=dev
		and now dev project baseURL will be used.

3) What about your custom env variables?

	Also you can't create your env variables inside config file.
	One way is to create a new fixture for env variables and import it in tests.
	
4) What about if I have some credentials and I don't want to keep inside my framework even for local execution?

	You can create .env file at root level and keep creds like below:
	DB_USER = admin
	DB_PASS = "password"
	APP_URL=http://uitestingplayground.com/ajax

	And now in your spec tests file you can use like below:
	await page.goTo(process.env.URL)

	also before using install the lib - npm i dotenv --save-dev --force

	Then come to pw config file and add below line after import

	require('dotenv').config();

	in config file already above line is written and commented

	also you can pass the env variable of .env file from command line also like

	SET URL=url npx playwright test --project=dev
	
	
5) One more way is using ternary operator i.e.
   
   baseURL: process.env.DEV === '1' ? 'http://localhost:4200',
          : process.env.STAGING === '1' ? 'http://localhost:4202'
		  : 'http://localhost:4201'
