Every API req have basically 6 components - URL, [PATH and QUERY PARAMETERS], METHOD, HEADERS, BODY
So if we keep all these components in test directly, it will be difficult to maintain and read.
So we can create a design strategy to separate these components.

So we created a class named RequestHandlerAPIClient which will have all these components as its properties 
inside utils folder.
And we will keep all api components inside this class as its methods.

Fluent interface design pattern is used to chain all these methods while calling the api in test file.
