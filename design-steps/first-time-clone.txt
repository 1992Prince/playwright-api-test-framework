1️⃣Once you clone repo and to install dependeciess run below command

 npm install - This installs all dependencies listed in package.json
 📌 This will install:

Playwright
TypeScript
Test runner
Any framework-specific libraries

2️⃣ Install Playwright Browsers (Very Important)

Even if Playwright is already in node_modules, browsers are not always installed.
npx playwright install

Optional (recommended for CI):
npx playwright install --with-deps


Then first we need to run independent tests inside this framework that is Regression Tests inside tests/conduit
command - npx playwright test tests/conduit/regressionTests.spec.ts
