Once u run scripts via - npx command then at root level test-results.json file will be created with all summmary of test execution
Then we run below command to extract data wch we want from that file
at root level terminal run command - node reporting/summary-generator.js test-results.json

once u run command u get details like below - 
{"timestamp":"2025-11-12T05:47:01.184Z","total":6,"passed":3,"failed":3,"skipped":0,"failures_by_category":{"unknown":3}}

Later u can improve it and after execution send as summary of execution via mail to all stakeholders or dev team 
or leads
Bcoz these just want overall status of execution and not details execution

To QA leads and sdets they should get both above one as summary and html report for debuging purpose

Write as req and tell how u developed it and via json reporing what data u can store and also
what data u can fetch and send to ES for observations or health

Task for Prince:
try to generate results.json file in playwright-report folder instead of root level.
